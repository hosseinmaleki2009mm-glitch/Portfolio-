          Hi, I&apos;m a passionate and detail-oriented developer with a strong
          interest in building creative, user-focused digital experiences. I
          specialize in modern web technologies like React, Next.js, and
          Node.js, and I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant, efficient
          solutions. With a background in both front-end and back-end
          development, I&apos;m always looking to learn new tools, contribute to
          meaningful projects, and grow as a developer. When I&apos;m not coding, you
          might find me exploring electronics with Raspberry Pi, playing
          volleyball, or sketching something new. Let&apos;s build something great
          together!
